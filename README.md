# Swagger UI example with AWS CDK, Typescript, API Gateway, and Lambda

This demonstrates a simple CDK stack containing an API Gateway API whose documentation is provided by a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) endpoint (/swagger).

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
